# Drowsiness_Detection using CNN
 The aim of this project is to develop an intelligent system that can detect drowsiness in individuals, especially drivers, using computer vision techniques and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). The system will analyze facial features in real-time to identify signs of drowsiness, providing timely alerts to prevent potential accidents.
